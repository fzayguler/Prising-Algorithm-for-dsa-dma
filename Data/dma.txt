REGULATION (EU) 2022/… OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE
COUNCIL

on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act)
(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114
thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee1,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions2,
▌
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,




Whereas:
(1)

Digital services in general and online platforms in particular play an increasingly important
role in the economy, in particular in the internal market, by enabling businesses to reach
users throughout the Union, by facilitating cross-border trade and by opening entirely
new business opportunities to a large number of companies in the Union to the benefit of
consumers in the Union.

(2)

▌At the same time, among those digital services, core platform services feature a number
of characteristics that can be exploited by the undertakings providing them. An example
of such characteristics of core platform services is extreme scale economies, which often
result from nearly zero marginal costs to add business users or end users. Other such
characteristics of core platform services are very strong network effects, an ability to
connect many business users with many end users through the multisidedness of these
services, a significant degree of dependence of both business users and end users, lock-in
effects, a lack of multi-homing for the same purpose by end users, vertical integration, and
data driven-advantages. All these characteristics, combined with unfair practices by
undertakings providing the core platform services, can have the effect of substantially
undermining the contestability of the core platform services, as well as impacting the
fairness of the commercial relationship between undertakings providing such services and
their business users and end users. In practice, this leads to rapid and potentially farreaching decreases in business users’ and end users’ choice, and therefore can confer on
the provider of those services the position of a so-called gatekeeper. At the same time, it
should be recognised that services which act in a non-commercial purpose capacity such
as collaborative projects should not be considered as core platform services for the
purpose of this Regulation.


(3)

A small number of large undertakings providing core platform services have emerged
with considerable economic power that would qualify them to be designated as
gatekeepers pursuant to this Regulation. Typically, such gatekeepers feature an ability to
connect many business users with many end users through their services, which, in turn,
enables them to leverage their advantages, such as their access to large amounts of data,
from one area of activity to another. Some of those gatekeepers exercise control over
whole platform ecosystems in the digital economy and are structurally extremely difficult
to challenge or contest by existing or new market operators, irrespective of how innovative
and efficient those market operators may be. Contestability is reduced in particular due to
the existence of very high barriers to entry or exit, including high investment costs, which
cannot, or not easily, be recuperated in case of exit, and the absence of, or reduced access
to, some key inputs in the digital economy, such as data. As a result, the likelihood
increases that the underlying markets do not function well, or will soon fail to function
well.

(4)

The combination of those features of gatekeeper is likely to lead, in many cases, to serious
imbalances in bargaining power and, consequently, to unfair practices and conditions for
business users, as well as for end users of core platform services provided by gatekeepers,
to the detriment of prices, quality, fair competition, choice and innovation in the market.


(5)

It follows that the market processes are often incapable of ensuring fair economic
outcomes with regard to core platform services. Although Articles 101 and 102 of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) apply to the conduct of
gatekeepers, the scope of those provisions is limited to certain instances of market power,
for example dominance on specific markets and of anti-competitive behaviour, and
enforcement occurs ex post and requires an extensive investigation of often very complex
facts on a case by case basis. Moreover, existing Union law does not address, or does not
address effectively, the challenges to the effective functioning of the internal market posed
by the conduct of gatekeepers that are not necessarily dominant in competition-law terms.

(6)

Gatekeepers have a significant impact on the internal market, providing gateways for a
large number of business users to reach end users everywhere in the Union and on different
markets. The adverse impact of unfair practices on the internal market and the particularly
weak contestability of core platform services, including the negative societal and economic
implications of such unfair practices, have led national legislators and sectoral regulators
to act. A number of ▌ regulatory solutions have already been adopted at national level or
proposed to address unfair practices and the contestability of digital services or at least
with regard to some of them. This has created ▌ divergent regulatory solutions which
results in the fragmentation of the internal market, thus raising the risk of increased
compliance costs due to different sets of national regulatory requirements.


(7)

Therefore, the purpose of this Regulation is to contribute to the proper functioning of the
internal market by laying down rules to ensure contestability and fairness for the
markets in the digital sector in general, and for business users and end users of core
platform services provided by gatekeepers in particular. Business users and end users of
core platform services provided by gatekeepers should be afforded appropriate regulatory
safeguards throughout the Union against the unfair practices of gatekeepers, in order to
facilitate cross-border business within the Union and thereby improve the proper
functioning of the internal market, and to eliminate existing or likely emerging
fragmentation in the specific areas covered by this Regulation. Moreover, while
gatekeepers tend to adopt global or at least pan-European business models and algorithmic
structures, they can adopt, and in some cases have adopted, different business conditions
and practices in different Member States, which is liable to create disparities between the
competitive conditions for the users of core platform services provided by gatekeepers, to
the detriment of integration of the internal market.

(8)

By approximating diverging national laws, it is possible to eliminate obstacles to the
freedom to provide and receive services, including retail services, within the internal
market. A targeted set of legal obligations should therefore be established at Union level to
ensure contestable and fair digital markets featuring the presence of gatekeepers within the
internal market to the benefit of the Union’s economy as a whole and ultimately of the
Union’s consumers.



(9)

Fragmentation of the internal market can only effectively be averted if Member States
are prevented from applying national rules which are within the scope of and pursue the
same objectives as this Regulation. That does not preclude the possibility of applying to
gatekeepers within the meaning of this Regulation other national ules which pursue
other legitimate public interest objectives as set out in the TFEU or which pursue
overriding reasons of public interest as recognised by the case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (‘the Court of Justice’).▌

(10)

At the same time, since this Regulation aims to complement the enforcement of
competition law, it should apply without prejudice to Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, to the
corresponding national competition rules and to other national competition rules
regarding unilateral conduct that are based on an individualised assessment of market
positions and behaviour, including its actual or likely effects and the precise scope of the
prohibited behaviour, and which provide for the possibility of undertakings to make
efficiency and objective justification arguments for the behaviour in question, and to
national rules concerning merger control. However, the application of those rules
should not affect the obligations imposed on gatekeepers under this Regulation and their
uniform and effective application in the internal market.


(11)

Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and the corresponding national competition rules concerning
anticompetitive multilateral and unilateral conduct as well as merger control have as their
objective the protection of undistorted competition on the market. This Regulation pursues
an objective that is complementary to, but different from that of protecting undistorted
competition on any given market, as defined in competition-law terms, which is to ensure
that markets where gatekeepers are present are and remain contestable and fair,
independently from the actual, likely or presumed effects of the conduct of a given
gatekeeper covered by this Regulation on competition on a given market. This Regulation
therefore aims to protect a different legal interest from that protected by those rules and it
should apply without prejudice to their application.


(12)

This Regulation should also apply without prejudice to the rules resulting from other
acts of Union law regulating certain aspects of the provision of services covered by this
Regulation, in particular Regulations (EU) 2016/6793, (EU) 2019/11504 and (EU) 2022/
…5+ of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Directives 2002/58/EC6,
2005/29/EC7, 2010/13/EU8, (EU) 2015/23669, (EU) 2019/79010 and (EU) 2019/88211 of





(13)

Weak contestability and unfair practices in the digital sector are more frequent and
pronounced for certain digital services than for others. This is the case in particular for
widespread and commonly used digital services that mostly directly intermediate between
business users and end users and where features such as extreme scale economies, very
strong network effects, an ability to connect many business users with many end users
through the multisidedness of these services, lock-in effects, a lack of multi-homing or
vertical integration are the most prevalent. Often, there is only one or very few large
undertakings providing those digital services. Those undertakings have emerged most
frequently as gatekeepers for business users and end users, with far-reaching impacts. In
particular, they have gained the ability to easily set commercial conditions and terms in a
unilateral and detrimental manner for their business users and end users. Accordingly, it is
necessary to focus only on those digital services that are most broadly used by business
users and end users and where ▌ concerns about weak contestability and unfair practices
by gatekeepers are more apparent and pressing from an internal market perspective.



(14)

In particular, online intermediation services, online search engines, operating systems,
online social networking, video sharing platform services, number-independent
interpersonal communication services, cloud computing services, virtual assistants, web
browsers and online advertising services, including advertising intermediation services,
all have the capacity to affect a large number of end users and businesses, which entails a
risk of unfair business practices. Therefore, they should be included in the definition of
core platform services and fall into the scope of this Regulation. Online intermediation
services can also be active in the field of financial services, and they can intermediate or
be used to provide such services as listed non-exhaustively in Annex II to Directive (EU)
2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council13. For the purposes of this
Regulation, the definition of core platform services should be technology neutral and
should be understood to encompass those provided on or through various means or
devices, such as connected TV or embedded digital services in vehicles. In certain
circumstances, the notion of end users should encompass users that are traditionally
considered business users, but in a given situation do not use the core platform services to
provide goods or services to other end users, such as for example businesses relying on
cloud computing services for their own purposes.

13

Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September
2015 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical
regulations and of rules on Information Society services (OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1).



(15)

The fact that a digital service qualifies as a core platform service ▌ does not in itself give
rise to sufficiently serious concerns of contestability or unfair practices. It is only when a
core platform service constitutes an important gateway and is operated by an undertaking
with a significant impact in the internal market and an entrenched and durable position, or
by an undertaking that will foreseeably enjoy such a position in the near future, that such
concerns arise. Accordingly, the targeted set of harmonised rules in this Regulation should
apply only to undertakings designated on the basis of those three objective criteria, and
they should only apply to those of their core platform services that individually constitute
an important gateway for business users to reach end users. The fact that it is possible that
an undertaking providing core platform services not only intermediates between business
users and end users, but also between end users and end users, for example in the case
of number-independent interpersonal communications services, should not preclude the
conclusion that such an undertaking is or could be an important gateway for business
users to reach end users.

(16)

In order to ensure the effective application of this Regulation to undertakings providing
core platform services which are most likely to satisfy those objective requirements, and
where unfair practices weakening contestability are most prevalent and have the most
impact, the Commission should be able to directly designate as gatekeepers those
undertakings providing core platform services which meet certain quantitative thresholds.
Such undertakings should in any event be subject to a fast designation process which
should start once this Regulation becomes applicable.


(17)

The fact that an undertaking has a very significant turnover in the Union and provides a
core platform service in at least three Member States constitutes compelling indication that
that undertaking has a significant impact on the internal market. This is equally true where
an undertaking providing a core platform service in at least three Member States has a
very significant market capitalisation or equivalent fair market value. Therefore, an
undertaking providing a core platform service should be presumed to have a significant
impact on the internal market where it provides a core platform service in at least three
Member States and where either its group turnover realised in the Union is equal to or
exceeds a specific, high threshold, or the market capitalisation of the group is equal to or
exceeds a certain high absolute value. For undertakings providing core platform services
that belong to undertakings that are not publicly listed, the equivalent fair market value ▌
should be used as the reference. It should be possible for the Commission to use its power
to adopt delegated acts to develop an objective methodology to calculate that value. A high
group turnover realised in the Union in conjunction with the threshold number of users in
the Union of core platform services reflects a relatively strong ability to monetise those
users. A high market capitalisation relative to the same threshold number of users in the
Union reflects a relatively significant potential to monetise those users in the near future.
This monetisation potential in turn reflects, in principle, the gateway position of the
undertakings concerned. Both indicators, in addition, reflect the financial capacity of the
undertakings concerned, including their ability to leverage their access to financial
markets to reinforce their position. This can, for example, happen where this superior
access is used to acquire other undertakings, an ability which has in turn been shown to
have potential negative effects on innovation. Market capitalisation can also reflect the
expected future position and effect on the internal market of the undertakings concerned,
despite a potentially relatively low current turnover. The market capitalisation value
should be based on a level that reflects the average market capitalisation of the largest
publicly listed undertakings in the Union over an appropriate period.



(18)

Whereas a market capitalisation ▌ at or above the threshold in the last financial year
should give rise to a presumption that an undertaking providing core platform services
has a ▌ significant impact on the internal market, a sustained market capitalisation of the
undertaking providing core platform services at or above the threshold over three or
more years should be considered as further strengthening that presumption.

(19)

By contrast, there could be a number of factors concerning market capitalisation that
would require an in-depth assessment in determining whether an undertaking providing
core platform services should be deemed to have a significant impact on the internal
market. This could be the case where the market capitalisation of the undertaking
providing core platform services in preceding financial years was significantly lower than
the threshold and the volatility of its market capitalisation over the observed period was
disproportionate to overall equity market volatility or its market capitalisation trajectory
relative to market trends was inconsistent with a rapid and unidirectional growth.


(20)

Having a very high number of business users that depend on a core platform service to
reach a very high number of monthly active end users enables the undertaking providing
that service to influence the operations of a substantial part of business users to its
advantage and indicate, in principle, that that undertaking is an important gateway. The
respective relevant levels for those numbers should be set representing a substantive
percentage of the entire population of the Union when it comes to end users and of the
entire population of businesses using platforms to determine the threshold for business
users. Active end users and business users should be identified and calculated in such a
way as to adequately represent the role and reach of the specific core platform service in
question. In order to provide legal certainty for gatekeepers, the elements to determine
the number of active end users and business users per core platform service should be
set out in an Annex to this Regulation. Such elements can be affected by technological
and other developments. The Commission should therefore be empowered to adopt a
delegated act to amend this Regulation by updating the methodology and the list of
indicators used to determine the number of active end users and active business users.



(21)

An entrenched and durable position in its operations or the foreseeability of enjoying such
a position in the future occurs notably where the contestability of the position of the
undertaking providing the core platform service is limited. This is likely to be the case
where that undertaking has provided a core platform service in at least three Member
States to a very high number of business users and end users over a period of at least 3
years.

(22)

Such thresholds can be affected by market and technical developments. The Commission
should therefore be empowered to adopt delegated acts to specify the methodology for
determining whether the quantitative thresholds are met, and to regularly adjust it to
market and technological developments where necessary. Such delegated acts should not
amend the quantitative thresholds set out in this Regulation.



(23)

An undertaking providing core platform services should be able, in exceptional
circumstances, to rebut the presumption that the undertaking has a ▌ significant impact
on the internal market by demonstrating that, although it meets the quantitative
thresholds set out in this Regulation, it does not fulfil the requirements for designation as
a gatekeeper. The burden of adducing evidence that the presumption deriving from the
fulfilment of the quantitative thresholds should not ▌ apply ▌ should be borne by that
undertaking. In its assessment of the evidence and arguments produced, the Commission
should take into account only those elements which directly relate to the quantitative
criteria, namely the impact of the undertaking providing core platform services on the
internal market beyond revenue or market cap, such as its size in absolute terms, and the
number of Member States in which it is present; by how much the actual business user
and end user numbers exceed the thresholds and the importance of the core platform
service provided, considering its overall scale of activities; and the number of years for
which the thresholds have been met. Any justification on economic grounds seeking to
enter into market definition or to demonstrate efficiencies deriving from a specific type of
behaviour by the undertaking providing core platform services should be discarded, as it is
not relevant to the designation as a gatekeeper. If the arguments submitted are not
sufficiently substantiated because they do not manifestly put into question the
presumption, it should be possible for the Commission to reject the arguments within the
timeframe of 45 working days provided for the designation. The Commission should be
able to take a decision by relying on information available on the quantitative thresholds
where the undertaking providing core platform services obstructs the investigation by
failing to comply with the investigative measures taken by the Commission.


(24)

Provision should also be made for the assessment of the gatekeeper role of undertakings
providing core platform services which do not satisfy all of the quantitative thresholds, in
light of the overall objective requirements that they have a significant impact on the
internal market, act as an important gateway for business users to reach end users and
benefit from a durable and entrenched position in their operations or it is foreseeable that it
will do so in the near future. When the undertaking providing core platform services is a
medium-sized, small or micro enterprise, the assessment should carefully take into
account whether such an undertaking would be able to substantially undermine the
contestability of the core platform services, since this Regulation primarily targets large
undertakings with considerable economic power rather than medium-sized, small or
micro enterprises.



(25)

Such an assessment can only be done in light of a market investigation, while taking into
account the quantitative thresholds. In its assessment the Commission should pursue the
objectives of preserving and fostering innovation and the quality of digital products and
services, the degree to which prices are fair and competitive, and the degree to which
quality or choice for business users and for end users is or remains high. Elements can be
taken into account that are specific to the undertakings providing core platform services
concerned, such as extreme scale or scope economies, very strong network effects, datadriven advantages, an ability to connect many business users with many end users through
the multisidedness of those services, lock-in effects, ▌ lack of multi-homing,
conglomerate corporate structure or vertical integration,. In addition, a very high market
capitalisation, a very high ratio of equity value over profit or a very high turnover derived
from end users of a single core platform service can be used as indicators of the leveraging
potential of such undertakings and of the tipping of the market in their favour. Together
with market capitalisation, high relative growth rates are examples of dynamic parameters
that are particularly relevant to identifying such undertakings providing core platform
services for which it is foreseeable that they will become entrenched. The Commission
should be able to take a decision by drawing adverse inferences from facts available where
the undertaking providing core platform services significantly obstructs the investigation
by failing to comply with the investigative measures taken by the Commission.



(26)

A particular subset of rules should apply to those undertakings providing core platform
services for which it is foreseeable that they will enjoy an entrenched and durable position
in the near future. The same specific features of core platform services make them prone to
tipping: once an undertaking providing the service ▌ has obtained a certain advantage
over rivals or potential challengers in terms of scale or intermediation power, its position
could become unassailable and the situation could evolve to the point that it is likely to
become durable and entrenched in the near future. Undertakings can try to induce this
tipping and emerge as gatekeeper by using some of the unfair conditions and practices
regulated under this Regulation. In such a situation, it appears appropriate to intervene
before the market tips irreversibly.

(27)

However, such early intervention should be limited to imposing only those obligations that
are necessary and appropriate to ensure that the services in question remain contestable and
enable the qualified risk of unfair conditions and practices to be avoided. Obligations that
prevent the undertaking providing core platform services concerned from enjoying an
entrenched and durable position in its operations, such as those preventing ▌ leveraging,
and those that facilitate switching and multi-homing are more directly geared towards this
purpose. To ensure proportionality, the Commission should moreover apply from that
subset of obligations only those that are necessary and proportionate to achieve the
objectives of this Regulation and should regularly review whether such obligations should
be maintained, suppressed or adapted.


(28)

Applying only those obligations that are necessary and proportionate to achieve the
objectives of this Regulation should allow the Commission to intervene in time and
effectively, while fully respecting the proportionality of the measures considered. It should
also reassure actual or potential market participants about the contestability and fairness of
the services concerned.

(29)

Gatekeepers should comply with the obligations laid down in this Regulation in respect of
each of the core platform services listed in the relevant designation decision. The
obligations should apply taking into account the conglomerate position of gatekeepers,
where applicable. Furthermore, it should be possible for the Commission to impose
implementing measures on the gatekeeper by decision▌. Those implementing measures
should be designed in an effective manner, having regard to the features of core platform
services and the possible circumvention risks, and in compliance with the principle of
proportionality and the fundamental rights of the undertakings concerned, as well as those
of third parties.


(30)

The very rapidly changing and complex technological nature of core platform services
requires a regular review of the status of gatekeepers, including those that it is foreseen will
enjoy an entrenched and durable position in their operations in the near future. To provide
all of the market participants, including the gatekeepers, with the required certainty as to
the applicable legal obligations, a time limit for such regular reviews is necessary. It is also
important to conduct such reviews on a regular basis and at least every 3 years.
Furthermore, it is important to clarify that not every change in the facts on the basis of
which an undertaking providing core platform services was designated as a gatekeeper
should require amendment of the designation decision. Amendment will only be
necessary if the change in the facts also leads to a change in the assessment. Whether or
not that is the case should be based on a case-by-case assessment of the facts and
circumstances.


(31)

To safeguard the contestability and fairness of core platform services provided by
gatekeepers, it is necessary to provide in a clear and unambiguous manner for a set of
harmonised rules with regard to those services. Such rules are needed to address the risk of
harmful effects of ▌ practices ▌ by gatekeepers, to the benefit of the business environment
in the services concerned, of users and ultimately of society as a whole. The obligations
correspond to those practices that are considered as undermining contestability or as
being unfair, or both, when taking into account the features of the digital sector and
which have a particularly negative direct impact on business users and end users. It
should be possible for the obligations laid down by this Regulation to specifically take
into account the nature of the core platform services provided. The obligations in this
Regulation should not only ensure contestability and fairness with respect to core
platform services listed in the designation decision, but also with respect to other digital
products and services into which gatekeepers leverage their gateway position, which are
often provided together with, or in support of, the core platform services.



(32)

For the purpose of this Regulation, contestability should relate to the ability of
undertakings to effectively overcome barriers to entry and expansion and challenge the
gatekeeper on the merits of their products and services. The features of core platform
services in the digital sector, such as network effects, strong economies of scale, and
benefits from data have limited the contestability of those services and the related
ecosystems. Such a weak contestability reduces the incentives to innovate and improve
products and services for the gatekeeper, its business users, its challengers and customers
and thus negatively affects the innovation potential of the wider online platform economy.
Contestability of the services in the digital sector can also be limited if there is more than
one gatekeeper for a core platform service. This Regulation should therefore ban certain
practices by gatekeepers that are liable to increase barriers to entry or expansion, and
impose certain obligations on gatekeepers that tend to lower those barriers. The
obligations should also address situations where the position of the gatekeeper may be
entrenched to such an extent that inter-platform competition is not effective in the short
term, meaning that intra-platform competition needs to be created or increased.


(33)

For the purpose of this Regulation, unfairness should relate to an imbalance between the
rights and obligations of business users where the gatekeeper obtains a disproportionate
advantage. Market participants, including business users of core platform services and
alternative providers of services provided together with, or in support of, such core
platform services, should have the ability to adequately capture the benefits resulting from
their innovative or other efforts. Due to their gateway position and superior bargaining
power, it is possible that gatekeepers engage in behaviour that does not allow others to
capture fully the benefits of their own contributions, and unilaterally set unbalanced
conditions for the use of their core platform services or services provided together with, or
in support of, their core platform services. Such imbalance is not excluded by the fact that
the gatekeeper offers a particular service free of charge to a specific group of users, and
may also consist in excluding or discriminating against business users, in particular if the
latter compete with the services provided by the gatekeeper. This Regulation should
therefore impose obligations on gatekeepers addressing such behaviour.


(34)

Contestability and fairness are intertwined. The lack of, or weak, contestability for a
certain service can enable a gatekeeper to engage in unfair practices. Similarly, unfair
practices by a gatekeeper can reduce the possibility of business users or others to contest
the gatekeeper’s position. A particular obligation in this Regulation may, therefore,
address both elements.

(35)

The obligations laid down in this Regulation are therefore necessary to address identified
public policy concerns, there being no alternative and less restrictive measures that would
effectively achieve the same result, having regard to need to safeguard public order, protect
privacy and fight fraudulent and deceptive commercial practices.



(36)

Gatekeepers often directly collect personal data of end users for the purpose of providing
online advertising services when end users use third party websites and software
applications. Third parties also provide gatekeepers with personal data of their end users
in order to make use of certain services provided by the gatekeepers in the context of
their core platform services, such as custom audiences. The processing, for the purpose
of providing online advertising services, of personal data from third parties using core
platform services gives gatekeepers potential advantages in terms of accumulation of data,
thereby raising barriers to entry. This is because gatekeepers process personal data from a
significantly larger number of third parties than other undertakings. Similar advantages
result from the conduct of (i) combining end user personal data collected from a core
platform service with data collected from other services, (ii) cross-using personal data
from a core platform service in other services provided separately by the gatekeeper,
notably services which are not provided together with, or in support of, the relevant core
platform service, and vice-versa, or (iii) signing-in end users to different services of
gatekeepers in order to combine personal data. To ensure that gatekeepers do not unfairly
undermine the contestability of core platform services, gatekeepers should enable ▌ end
users to freely choose to opt-in to such data processing and sign-in practices by offering a
less personalised but equivalent alternative, and without making the use of the core
platform service or certain functionalities thereof conditional upon the end user’s
consent. This should be without prejudice to the gatekeeper processing personal data or
signing in end users to a service, relying on the legal basis under Article 6(1), points (c),
(d) and (e), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, but not on Article 6(1), points (b) and (f) of
that Regulation.


(37)

The less personalised alternative should not be different or of degraded quality
compared to the service provided to the end users who provide consent, unless a
degradation of quality is a direct consequence of the gatekeeper not being able to process
such personal data or signing in end users to a service. Not giving consent should not be
more difficult than giving consent. When the gatekeeper requests consent, it should
proactively present a user-friendly solution to the end user to provide, modify or
withdraw consent in an explicit, clear and straightforward manner. In particular,
consent should be given by a clear affirmative action or statement establishing a freely
given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of agreement by the end user, as
defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. At the time of giving consent, and only where
applicable, the end user should be informed that not giving consent can lead to a less
personalised offer, but that otherwise the core platform service will remain unchanged
and that no functionalities will be suppressed. Exceptionally, if consent cannot be given
directly to the gatekeeper's core platform service, end users should be able to give
consent through each third party service that makes use of that core platform service, to
allow the gatekeeper to process personal data for the purposes of providing online
advertising services.



Lastly, it should be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it. Gatekeepers should not
design, organise or operate their online interfaces in a way that deceives, manipulates or
otherwise materially distorts or impairs the ability of end users to freely give consent. In
particular, gatekeepers should not be allowed to prompt end users more than once a year
to give consent for the same processing purpose in respect of which they initially did not
give consent or withdrew their consent. This Regulation is without prejudice to
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including its enforcement framework, which remains fully
applicable with respect to any claims by data subjects relating to an infringement of their
rights under that Regulation.
(38)

Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, in particular as
regards the use of their personal data for the purposes of commercial communication or
creating user profiles. The protection of children online is an important objective of the
Union and should be reflected in the relevant Union law. [In this context, due regard
should be given to Regulation (EU) 2022/…+]. Nothing in this Regulation exempts
gatekeepers from the obligation to protect children laid down in applicable Union law.

(39)

In certain cases, for instance through the imposition of contractual terms and
conditions, gatekeepers can restrict the ability of business users of their online
intermediation services to offer products or services to end users under more favourable
conditions, including price, through other online intermediation services or through direct
online sales channels. Where such restrictions relate to third party online intermediation
services, they limit inter-platform contestability, which in turn limits choice of alternative
online intermediation services for end users. Where such restrictions relate to direct
online sales channels, they unfairly limit the freedom of business users to use such
channels. To ensure that business users of online intermediation services of gatekeepers
can freely choose alternative online intermediation services or direct online sales channels
and differentiate the conditions under which they offer their products or services to ▌ end
users, it should not be accepted that gatekeepers limit business users from choosing to
differentiate commercial conditions, including price. Such a restriction should apply to any
measure with equivalent effect, such as increased commission rates or de-listing of the
offers of business users.



(40)

To prevent further reinforcing their dependence on the core platform services of
gatekeepers, and in order to promote multi-homing, the business users of those
gatekeepers should be free to promote and choose the distribution channel that they
consider most appropriate for the purpose of interacting with any end users that those
business users have already acquired through core platform services provided by the
gatekeeper or through other distribution channels. This should apply to the promotion of
offers, including through a software application of the business user, and any form of
communication and conclusion of contracts between business users and end users. An
acquired end user is an end user who has already entered into a commercial relationship
with the business user and, where applicable, the gatekeeper has been directly or
indirectly remunerated by the business user for facilitating the initial acquisition of the
end user by the business user. Such commercial relationships can be on either a paid or
a free basis, such as free trials or free service tiers, and can have been entered into either
on the core platform service of the gatekeeper or through any other channel. Conversely,
end users should also be free to choose offers of such business users and to enter into
contracts with them either through core platform services of the gatekeeper, if applicable,
or from a direct distribution channel of the business user or another indirect distribution
channel that such business user uses.



(41)

The ability of end users to acquire content, subscriptions, features or other items outside
the core platform services of the gatekeeper should not be undermined or restricted. In
particular, a situation should be avoided whereby gatekeepers restrict end users from
access to, and use of, such services via a software application running on their core
platform service. For example, subscribers to online content purchased outside a
software application, software application store or virtual assistant should not be
prevented from accessing such online content on a software application on the core
platform service of the gatekeeper simply because it was purchased outside such
software application, software application store or virtual assistant.

(42)

To safeguard a fair commercial environment and protect the contestability of the digital
sector it is important to safeguard the right of business users and end users, including
whistleblowers, to raise concerns about unfair practices by gatekeepers raising any issue
of non-compliance with the relevant Union or national law with any relevant
administrative or other public authorities, including national courts. For example, it is
possible that business users or end users will want to complain about different types of
unfair practices, such as discriminatory access conditions, unjustified closing of business
user accounts or unclear grounds for product de-listings. Any practice that would in any
way inhibit or hinder those users in raising their concerns or in seeking available redress,
for instance by means of confidentiality clauses in agreements or other written terms,
should therefore be prohibited. This prohibition should be without prejudice to the right of
business users and gatekeepers to lay down in their agreements the terms of use including
the use of lawful complaints-handling mechanisms, including any use of alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms or of the jurisdiction of specific courts in compliance with
respective Union and national law. This should ▌ also be without prejudice to the role
gatekeepers play in the fight against illegal content online.



(43)

Certain services provided together with, or in support of, relevant core platform services
of the gatekeeper, such as identification services, web browser engines, payment services
or technical services that support the provision of payment services, such as payment
systems for in-app purchases, are crucial for business users to conduct their business and
allow them ▌ to optimise services. In particular, each browser is built on a web browser
engine, which is responsible for key browser functionality such as speed, reliability and
web compatibility. When gatekeepers operate and impose web browser engines, they are
in a position to determine the functionality and standards that will apply not only to their
own web browsers, but also to competing web browsers and, in turn, to web software
applications. ▌ Gatekeepers should therefore not use their position to require their
dependent business users to use any of the core platform services provided by the
gatekeeper itself as part of the provision of services or products by those business users. In
order to avoid a situation in which gatekeepers indirectly impose on business users their
own services provided together with, or in support of, core platform services, gatekeepers
should also be prohibited from requiring end users to use such services, when that
requirement would be imposed in the context of the service provided to end users by the
business user using the core platform service of the gatekeeper. That prohibition aims to
protect the freedom of the business user to choose alternative services to the ones of the
gatekeeper, but should not be construed as obliging the business user to offer such
alternatives to its end users.

(44)

The conduct of requiring business users or end users to subscribe to, or register with,
any other core platform services of gatekeepers listed in the designation decision as a
condition for using, accessing, signing up for or registering with a core platform service
gives the gatekeeper a means of capturing and locking-in new business users and end
users for their core platform services by ensuring that business users cannot access one
core platform service without also at least registering or creating an account for the
purposes of receiving a second core platform service. That conduct also gives
gatekeepers a potential advantage in terms of accumulation of data. As such, this
conduct is liable to raise barriers to entry and should be prohibited.



(45)

The conditions under which gatekeepers provide online advertising services to business
users, including both advertisers and publishers, are often non-transparent and opaque.
This opacity is partly linked to the practices of a few platforms, but is also due to the sheer
complexity of modern day programmatic advertising. That sector is considered to have
become less transparent after the introduction of new privacy legislation ▌. This often
leads to a lack of information and knowledge for advertisers and publishers about the
conditions of the online advertising services they purchase and undermines their ability to
switch between undertakings providing online advertising services. Furthermore, the costs
of online advertising services under these conditions are likely to be higher than they
would be in a fairer, more transparent and contestable platform environment. Those higher
costs are likely to be reflected in the prices that end users pay for many daily products and
services relying on the use of online advertising services. Transparency obligations should
therefore require gatekeepers to provide advertisers and publishers to whom they supply
online advertising services, when requested, with free of charge information that allows
both sides to understand the price paid for each of the different online advertising services
provided as part of the relevant advertising value chain. This information should be
provided, upon request, to an advertiser at the level of an individual advertisement in
relation to the price and fees charged to that advertiser and, subject to an agreement by
the publisher owning the inventory where the advertisement is displayed, the
remuneration received by that consenting publisher. The provision of this information
on a daily basis will allow advertisers to receive information that has a sufficient level of
granularity necessary to compare the costs of using the online advertising services of
gatekeepers with the costs of using online advertising services of alternative
undertakings. Where some publishers do not provide their consent to the sharing of the
relevant information with the advertiser, the gatekeeper should provide the advertiser
with the information about the daily average remuneration received by those publishers
for the relevant advertisements. The same obligation and principles of sharing the
relevant information concerning the provision of online advertising services should
apply in respect of requests by publishers. Since gatekeepers can use different pricing
models for the provision of online advertising services to advertisers and publishers, for
instance a price per impression, per view or any other criterion, gatekeepers should also
provide the method with which each of the prices and remunerations are calculated.



(46)

In certain circumstances, a gatekeeper has a dual role as an undertaking providing core
platform services, whereby it provides a core platform service, and possibly other services
provided together with, or in support of, that core platform service to its business users,
while also competing or intending to compete with those same business users in the
provision of the same or similar services or products to the same end users. In those
circumstances, a gatekeeper can take advantage of its dual role to use data, generated or
provided by its business users in the context of activities by those business users when
using the core platform services or the services provided together with, or in support of,
those core platform services, for the purpose of its own services or products. The data of
the business user can also include any data generated by or provided during the
activities of its end users. This can be the case, for instance, where a gatekeeper provides
an online marketplace or a software application store to business users, and at the same
time provides services as an undertaking providing online retail services or software
application ▌. To prevent gatekeepers from unfairly benefitting from their dual role, it is
necessary to ensure that they do not use any aggregated or non-aggregated data, which
could include anonymised and personal data that is not publicly available to provide
similar services to those of their business users. That obligation should apply to the
gatekeeper as a whole, including but not limited to its business unit that competes with the
business users of a core platform service.



(47)

Business users can also purchase online advertising services from an undertaking
providing core platform services for the purpose of providing goods and services to end
users. In this case, it can happen that the data are not generated on the core platform
service, but are provided to the core platform service by the business user or are generated
based on its operations through the core platform service concerned. In certain instances,
that core platform service providing advertising can have a dual role as both an
undertaking providing online advertising services and an undertaking providing services
competing with business users. Accordingly, the obligation prohibiting a dual role
gatekeeper from using data of business users should apply also with respect to the data that
a core platform service has received from businesses for the purpose of providing online
advertising services related to that core platform service.

(48)

In relation to cloud computing services, the obligation not to use the data of business
users should extend to data provided or generated by business users of the gatekeeper in
the context of their use of the cloud computing service of the gatekeeper, or through its
software application store that allows end users of cloud computing services access to
software applications. That obligation should not affect the right of gatekeepers to use
aggregated data for providing other services provided together with, or in support of, its
core platform service, such as data analytics services, subject to compliance with
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC, as well as with the relevant
obligations in this Regulation concerning such services.


(49)

A gatekeeper can use different means to favour its own or third party services or products
on its operating system, virtual assistant or web browser, to the detriment of the same or
similar services that end users could obtain through other third parties. This can for
instance happen where certain software applications or services are pre-installed by a
gatekeeper. To enable end user choice, gatekeepers should not prevent end users from uninstalling any ▌ software applications on its operating system. It should be possible for
the gatekeeper to restrict such un-installation only when such software applications are
essential to the functioning of the operating system or the device. Gatekeepers should
also allow end users to easily change the default settings on the operating system, virtual
assistant and web browser when those default settings favour their own software
applications and services. This includes prompting a choice screen, at the moment of the
users’ first use of an online search engine, virtual assistant or web browser of the
gatekeeper listed in the designation decision, allowing end users to select an alternative
default service when the operating system of the gatekeeper directs end users to those
online search engine, virtual assistant or web browser and when the virtual assistant or
the web browser of the gatekeeper direct the user to the online search engine listed in the
designation decision.



(50)

The rules that a gatekeeper sets for the distribution of software applications can, in certain
circumstances, restrict the ability of end users to install and effectively use third party
software applications or software application stores on hardware or operating systems of
that gatekeeper and restrict the ability of end users to access such software applications or
software application stores outside the core platform services of that gatekeeper. Such
restrictions can limit the ability of developers of software applications to use alternative
distribution channels and the ability of end users to choose between different software
applications from different distribution channels and should be prohibited as unfair and
liable to weaken the contestability of core platform services. To ensure contestability, the
gatekeeper should furthermore allow the third party software applications or software
application stores to prompt the end user to decide whether that service should become
the default and enable that change to be carried out easily. In order to ensure that third
party software applications or software application stores do not endanger the integrity of
the hardware or operating system provided by the gatekeeper, it should be possible for the
gatekeeper concerned to implement proportionate technical or contractual measures to
achieve that goal if the gatekeeper demonstrates that such measures are necessary and
justified and that there are no less-restrictive means to safeguard the integrity of the
hardware or operating system. The integrity of the hardware or the operating system
should include any design options that need to be implemented and maintained in order
for the hardware or the operating system to be protected against unauthorised access, by
ensuring that security controls specified for the hardware or the operating system
concerned cannot be compromised. Furthermore, in order to ensure that third party
software applications or software application stores do not undermine end users’
security, it should be possible for the gatekeeper to implement strictly necessary and
proportionate measures and settings, other than default settings, enabling end users to
effectively protect security in relation to third party software applications or software
application stores if the gatekeeper demonstrates that such measures and settings are
strictly necessary and proportionate and that there are no less-restrictive means to
achieve that goal. The gatekeeper should be prevented from implementing such
measures as a default setting or as pre-installation.


(51)

Gatekeepers are often vertically integrated and offer certain products or services to end
users through their own core platform services, or through a business user over which they
exercise control which frequently leads to conflicts of interest. This can include the
situation whereby a gatekeeper provides its own online intermediation services through an
online search engine. When offering those products or services on the core platform
service, gatekeepers can reserve a better position, in terms of ranking, and related
indexing and crawling, for their own offering than that of the products or services of
third parties also operating on that core platform service. This can occur for instance with
products or services, including other core platform services, which are ranked in the results
communicated by online search engines, or which are partly or entirely embedded in online
search engines results, groups of results specialised in a certain topic, displayed along with
the results of an online search engine, which are considered or used by certain end users as
a service distinct or additional to the online search engine. Other instances are those of
software applications which are distributed through software application stores, or videos
distributed through a video-sharing platform, or products or services that are given
prominence and display in the newsfeed of an online social networking service, or
products or services ranked in search results or displayed on an online marketplace, or
products or services offered through a virtual assistant. Such reserving of a better
position of gatekeeper’s own offering can take place even before ranking following a
query, such as during crawling and indexing. For example, already during crawling, as
a discovery process by which new and updated content is being found, as well as
indexing, which entails storing and organising of the content found during the crawling
process, the gatekeeper can favour its own content over that of third parties. In those
circumstances, the gatekeeper is in a dual-role position as intermediary for third party
undertakings and as undertaking directly providing products or services. Consequently,
such gatekeepers have the ability to undermine directly the contestability for those
products or services on those core platform services, to the detriment of business users
which are not controlled by the gatekeeper.


(52)

In such situations, the gatekeeper should not engage in any form of differentiated or
preferential treatment in ranking on the core platform service, and related indexing and
crawling, whether through legal, commercial or technical means, in favour of products or
services it offers itself or through a business user which it controls. To ensure that this
obligation is effective, the conditions that apply to such ranking should also be generally
fair and transparent. Ranking should in this context cover all forms of relative
prominence, including display, rating, linking or voice results and should also include
instances where a core platform service presents or communicates only one result to the
end user. To ensure that this obligation is effective and cannot be circumvented, it should
also apply to any measure that has an equivalent effect to the differentiated or preferential
treatment in ranking. The guidelines adopted pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EU)
2019/1150 should also facilitate the implementation and enforcement of this obligation.

(53)

Gatekeepers should not restrict or prevent the free choice of end users by technically or
otherwise preventing switching between or subscription to different software applications
and services. This would allow more undertakings to offer their services, thereby
ultimately providing greater choice to the end users. Gatekeepers should ensure a free
choice irrespective of whether they are the manufacturer of any hardware by means of
which such software applications or services are accessed and shall not raise artificial
technical or other barriers so as to make switching impossible or ineffective. The mere
offering of a given product or service to consumers, including by means of pre-installation,
as well as the improvement of the offering to end users, such as price reductions or
increased quality, should not be construed as constituting a prohibited barrier to switching.

(54)

Gatekeepers can hamper the ability of end users to access online content and services,
including software applications. Therefore, rules should be established to ensure that the
rights of end users to access an open internet are not compromised by the conduct of
gatekeepers. Gatekeepers can also technically limit the ability of end users to effectively
switch between different undertakings providing internet access service ▌, in particular
through their control over hardware or operating systems . This distorts the level playing
field for internet access services and ultimately harms end users. It should therefore be
ensured that gatekeepers do not unduly restrict end users in choosing the undertaking
providing their internet access service ▌.

(55)

A gatekeeper can provide services or hardware, such as wearable devices, that access
hardware or software features of a device accessed or controlled via an operating system
or virtual assistant in order to offer specific functionalities to end users. In that case,
competing service or hardware providers, such as providers of wearable devices, require
equally effective interoperability with, and access for the purposes of interoperability to,
the same hardware or software features to be able to provide a competitive offering to
end users.

(56)

Gatekeepers can also have a dual role as developers of operating systems and device
manufacturers, including any technical functionality that such a device may have. For
example, a gatekeeper that is a manufacturer of a device can restrict access to some of the
functionalities in that device, such as near-field-communication technology secure
elements and processors, authentication mechanisms and the software used to operate
those technologies, which can be required for the effective provision of a service ▌
provided together with, or in support of, the core platform service by the gatekeeper as
well as by any potential third party undertaking providing such service.



(57)

If dual roles are used in a manner that prevents alternative service and hardware
providers from having access under equal conditions to the same operating system,
hardware or software features that are available or used by the gatekeeper in the
provision of its own complementary or supporting services or hardware, this could
significantly undermine innovation by such alternative providers, as well as choice for
end users. The gatekeepers should, therefore, be required to ensure, free of charge,
effective interoperability with, and access for the purposes of interoperability to, the
same operating system, hardware or software features that are available or used in the
provision of its own complementary and supporting services and hardware. Such access
can equally be required by software applications related to the relevant services provided
together with or in support of the core platform service in order to effectively develop
and provide functionalities interoperable with those provided by gatekeepers. The aim of
the obligations is to allow competing third parties to interconnect through interfaces or
similar solutions to the respective features as effectively as the gatekeeper’s own services
or hardware.



(58)

The conditions under which gatekeepers provide online advertising services to business
users including both advertisers and publishers are often non-transparent and opaque. This
often leads to a lack of information for advertisers and publishers about the effect of a
given advertisement. To further enhance fairness, transparency and contestability of online
advertising services listed in the designation decision as well as those that are fully
integrated with other core platform services of the same undertaking, ▌ gatekeepers
should ▌ provide advertisers and publishers, and third parties authorised by advertisers
and publishers, when requested, with free of charge access to the gatekeepers’
performance measuring tools and the data, including aggregated and non-aggregated
data, necessary for advertisers, authorised third parties such as advertising agencies
acting on behalf of a company placing advertising, as well as for publishers to carry out
their own independent verification of the provision of the relevant online advertising
services.



(59)

Gatekeepers benefit from access to vast amounts of ▌ data that they collect while
providing the core platform services, as well as ▌ other digital services. To ensure that
gatekeepers do not undermine the ▌ contestability of core platform services, or the
innovation potential of ▌ the dynamic digital sector, by restricting switching or
multi-homing, end users, as well as third parties authorised by an end user, should be
granted effective and ▌ immediate access to the data they provided or that was generated
through their activity on the relevant core ▌ platform services of the gatekeeper. The data
should be received in a format that can be immediately and effectively accessed and used
by the end user or the relevant third party authorised by the end user to which the data is
ported. Gatekeepers should also ensure, by means of appropriate and high quality
technical measures, such as application programming interfaces, that end users or third
parties authorised by end users can freely port the data continuously and in real time.
This should apply also to any other data at different ▌ levels of aggregation necessary to
effectively enable such ▌ portability. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation on the
gatekeeper to ensure effective portability of data under this Regulation complements the
right to data portability under the Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Facilitating switching or
multi-homing should lead, in ▌ turn, to an increased choice for ▌ end users and acts as an
▌ incentive for gatekeepers and business users to innovate.


(60)

Business users that use ▌ core platform services provided by gatekeepers, and end users of
such business users provide and generate a vast amount of data ▌. In order to ensure that
business users have access to the relevant data thus generated, the gatekeeper should, upon
their request, provide effective access, free of charge, to such data. Such access should also
be given to third parties contracted by the business user, who are acting as processors of
this data for the business user. The access should include access to data provided or
generated by the same business users and the same end users of those business users in the
context of other services provided by the same gatekeeper, including services provided
together with or in support of core platform serviceswhere this is inextricably linked to
the relevant request. To this end, a gatekeeper should not use any contractual or other
restrictions to prevent business users from accessing relevant data and should enable
business users to obtain consent of their end users for such data access and retrieval, where
such consent is required under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC.
Gatekeepers should also ensure the continuous and real time access to such data ▌ by
means of appropriate technical measures, such as for example putting in place high quality
application programming interfaces or integrated tools for small volume business users.


(61)

The value of online search engines to their respective business users and end users
increases as the total number of such users increases. Undertakings providing online
search engines collect and store aggregated datasets containing information about what
users searched for, and how they interacted with, the results with which they were
provided. Undertakings providing online search engine services collect these data from
searches undertaken on their own online search engine service and, where applicable,
searches undertaken on the platforms of their downstream commercial partners. Access by
gatekeepers to such ranking, query, click and view data constitutes an important barrier to
entry and expansion, which undermines the contestability of online search engine services.
Gatekeepers should therefore be required to provide access, on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, to those ranking, query, click and view data in relation to free and
paid search generated by consumers on online search engine services to other
undertakings providing such services, so that those third-party undertakings can optimise
their services and contest the relevant core platform services. Such access should also be
given to third parties contracted by a search engine provider, who are acting as processors
of this data for that search engine. When providing access to its search data, a gatekeeper
should ensure the protection of the personal data of end users, including against possible
re-identification risks, by appropriate means, such as anonymisation of such personal
data, without substantially degrading the quality or usefulness of the data. The relevant
data is anonymised if personal data is irreversibly altered in such a way that information
does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or where personal data is
rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or is no longer
identifiable.


(62)

For software application stores, online search engines and online social networking
services listed in the designation decision, gatekeepers should publish and apply general
conditions of access that should be fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory. Those
general conditions should provide for a Union based alternative dispute settlement
mechanism that is easily accessible, impartial, independent and free of charge for the
business user, without prejudice to the business user’s own cost and proportionate
measures aimed at preventing the abuse of the dispute settlement mechanism by business
users. The dispute settlement mechanism should be without prejudice to the right of
business users to seek redress before judicial authorities in accordance with Union and
national law. In particular, gatekeepers which provide access to software application stores
are an important gateway for business users that seek to reach end users. In view of the
imbalance in bargaining power between those gatekeepers and business users of their
software application stores, those gatekeepers should not be allowed to impose general
conditions, including pricing conditions, that would be unfair or lead to unjustified
differentiation. Pricing or other general access conditions should be considered unfair if
they lead to an imbalance of rights and obligations imposed on business users or confer an
advantage on the gatekeeper which is disproportionate to the service provided by the
gatekeeper to business users or lead to a disadvantage for business users in providing the
same or similar services as the gatekeeper. The following benchmarks can serve as a
yardstick to determine the fairness of general access conditions: prices charged or
conditions imposed for the same or similar services by other providers of software
application stores; prices charged or conditions imposed by the provider of the software
application store for different related or similar services or to different types of end users;
prices charged or conditions imposed by the provider of the software application store for
the same service in different geographic regions; prices charged or conditions imposed by
the provider of the software application store for the same service the gatekeeper provides
to itself. This obligation should not establish an access right and it should be without
prejudice to the ability of providers of software application stores, online search engines


and online social networking services to take the required responsibility in the fight
against illegal and unwanted content as set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/…+ .


(63)

Gatekeepers can hamper the ability of business users and end users to unsubscribe from
a core platform service that they have previously subscribed to. Therefore, rules should
be established to avoid a situation in which gatekeepers undermine the rights of business
users and end users to freely choose which core platform service they use. To safeguard
free choice of business users and end users, a gatekeeper should not be allowed to make
it unnecessarily difficult or complicated for business users or end users to unsubscribe
from a core platform service. Closing an account or un-subscribing should not be made
be more complicated than opening an account or subscribing to the same service.
Gatekeepers should not demand additional fees when terminating agreements with their
end users or business users. Gatekeepers should ensure that the conditions for
terminating contracts are always proportionate and can be exercised without undue
difficulty by end users, such as, for example, in relation to the reasons for termination,
the notice period, or the form of such termination. This is without prejudice to national
legislation applicable in accordance with the Union law laying down rights and
obligations concerning conditions of termination of provision of core platform services
by end users.

(64)

The lack of interoperability allows gatekeepers that provide number-independent
interpersonal communications services to benefit from strong network effects, which
contributes to the weakening of contestability. Furthermore, regardless of whether end
users ‘multi-home’, gatekeepers often provide number-independent interpersonal
communications services as part of their platform ecosystem, and this further
exacerbates entry barriers for alternative providers of such services and increases costs
for end users to switch. Without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European
Parliament and of the Council14 and, in particular, the conditions and procedures laid
down in Article 61 thereof, gatekeepers should therefore ensure, free of charge and
upon request, interoperability with certain basic functionalities of their numberindependent interpersonal communications services that they provide to their own end
users, to third party providers of such services. Gatekeepers should ensure
interoperability for third party providers of number-independent interpersonal
communications services that offer or intend to offer their number-independent
interpersonal communications services to end users and business users in the Union. To
facilitate the practical implementation of such interoperability, the gatekeeper concerned
should be required to publish a reference offer laying down the technical details and
general terms and conditions of interoperability with its number-independent
interpersonal communications services. It should be possible for the Commission, if
applicable, to consult the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications,
in order to determine whether the technical details and the general terms and conditions
published in the reference offer that the gatekeeper intends to implement or has
implemented ensures compliance with this obligation.

14



In all cases, the gatekeeper and the requesting provider should ensure that
interoperability does not undermine a high level of security and data protection in line
with their obligations laid down in this Regulation and applicable Union law, in
particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC. The obligation related
to interoperability should be without prejudice to the information and choices to be made
available to end users of the number-independent interpersonal communication services
of the gatekeeper and the requesting provider under this Regulation and other Union
law, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679.


(65)

To ensure the effectiveness of the obligations laid down by this Regulation, while also
making certain that those obligations are limited to what is necessary to ensure
contestability and tackling the harmful effects of the unfair practices by gatekeepers, it is
important to clearly define and circumscribe them so as to allow the gatekeeper to fully
comply with them, whilst fully complying with applicable law, and in particular
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC and legislation on consumer
protection, cyber security, product safety and accessibility requirements, including
Directive (EU) 2019/882 and Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and
of the Council15. The gatekeepers should ensure the compliance with this Regulation by
design. Therefore, the necessary measures should be, , integrated as much as possible into
the technological design used by the gatekeepers. ▌ It may in certain cases be appropriate
for the Commission, following a dialogue with the gatekeeper concerned and, after
enabling third parties to make comments, to further specify some of the measures that the
gatekeeper concerned should adopt in order to effectively comply with ▌ obligations that
are susceptible of being further specified or, in the event of circumvention, with all
obligations. In particular, such further specification should be possible where the
implementation of an obligation susceptible to being further specified can be affected by
variations of services within a single category of core platform services. For this
purpose, it should be possible for the gatekeeper to request the Commission to engage in
a process whereby the Commission can further specify some of the measures that the
gatekeeper concerned should adopt in order to effectively comply with those obligations.


The Commission should have a discretion as to whether and when such further
specification should be provided, while respecting the principles of equal treatment,
proportionality, and good administration. In this respect, the Commission should provide
the main reasons underlying its assessment, including the enforcement priorities that it
has set. This process should not be used to undermine the effectiveness of this
Regulation. Furthermore, this process is without prejudice to the powers of the
Commission to adopt a decision establishing non-compliance with any of the obligations
laid down in this Regulation by a gatekeeper, including the possibility to impose fines or
periodic penalty payments. The Commission should be able to reopen proceedings,
including where the specified measures turn out not to be effective. A reopening due to
an ineffective specification adopted by decision should enable the Commission to amend
the specification prospectively. The Commission should also be able to set a reasonable
time period within which the proceedings can be reopened if the specified measures turn
out not to be effective.


(66)

As an additional element to ensure proportionality, gatekeepers should be given an
opportunity to request the suspension, to the extent necessary, of a specific obligation in
exceptional circumstances that lie beyond the control of the gatekeeper, such as an
unforeseen external shock that has temporarily eliminated a significant part of end user
demand for the relevant core platform service, where compliance with a specific obligation
is shown by the gatekeeper to endanger the economic viability of the Union operations of
the gatekeeper concerned. The Commission should identify the exceptional
circumstances justifying the suspension and review it on a regular basis in order to
assess whether the conditions for granting it are still viable.

(67)

In exceptional circumstances, justified on the limited grounds of public ▌ health or public
security laid down in Union law and interpreted by the Court of Justice, the Commission
should be able to decide that a specific obligation does not apply to a specific core
platform service. If harm is caused to such public interests that could indicate that the
cost to society as a whole of enforcing a certain obligation is, in a specific exceptional
case, too high and thus disproportionate. Where appropriate, the Commission should be
able to facilitate compliance by assessing whether a limited and duly justified suspension
or exemption is justified. This should ensure the proportionality of the obligations in this
Regulation without undermining the intended ex ante effects on fairness and contestability.
Where such an exemption is granted, the Commission should review its decision every
year.



(68)

Within the timeframe for complying with their obligations under this Regulation,
gatekeepers should inform the Commission, through mandatory reporting, about the
measures they intend to implement or have implemented in order to ensure effective
compliance with those obligations, including those measures concerning compliance
with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, to the extent they are relevant for compliance with the
obligations provided under this Regulation, which should allow the Commission to fulfil
its duties under this Regulation. In addition, a clear and comprehensible nonconfidential summary of such information should be made publicly available while
taking into account the legitimate interest of gatekeepers in the protection of their
business secrets and other confidential information. This non-confidential publication
should enable third parties to assess whether the gatekeepers comply with the obligations
laid down in this Regulation. Such reporting should be without prejudice to any
enforcement action by the Commission at any time following the reporting. The
Commission should publish online the non-confidential summary of the report, as well
as all other public information based on information obligations under this Regulation,
in order to ensure accessibility of such information in a usable and comprehensive
manner, in particular for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

(69)

The obligations of gatekeepers should only be updated after a thorough investigation
into the nature and impact of specific practices that may be newly identified, following
an in-depth investigation, as unfair or limiting contestability in the same manner as the
unfair practices laid down in this Regulation while potentially escaping the scope of the
current set of obligations. The Commission should be able to launch an investigation
with a view to determining whether the existing obligations need to be updated, either on
its own initiative or following a justified request of at least three Member States. When
presenting such justified requests, it should be possible for Member States to include
information on newly introduced offers of products, services, software or features which
raise concerns of contestability or fairness, whether implemented in the context of
existing core platform services or otherwise. Where, following a market investigation,
the Commission deems it necessary to modify essential elements of this Regulation, such
as the inclusion of new obligations that depart from the same contestability or fairness
issues addressed by this Regulation, the Commission should advance a proposal to
amend this Regulation.


(70)

Given the substantial economic power of gatekeepers, it is important that these
obligations are applied effectively and are not circumvented. To that end, the rules in
question should apply to any practices by a gatekeeper, irrespective of its form and
irrespective of whether it is of a contractual, commercial, technical or any other nature,
insofar as the practice corresponds to the type of practice that is the subject of one of the
obligations laid down by this Regulation. Gatekeepers should not engage in behaviour
that would undermine the effectiveness of the prohibitions and obligations laid down in
this Regulation. Such behaviour includes the design used by the gatekeeper, the
presentation of end-user choices in a non-neutral manner, or using the structure,
function or manner of operation of a user interface or a part thereof to subvert or impair
user autonomy, decision-making, or choice. Furthermore, the gatekeeper should not be
allowed to engage in any behaviour undermining interoperability as required under this
Regulation, such as for example by using unjustified technical protection measures,
discriminatory terms of service, unlawfully claiming a copyright on application
programming interfaces or providing misleading information. Gatekeepers should not be
allowed to circumvent their designation by artificially segmenting, dividing, subdividing,
fragmenting or splitting their core platform services to circumvent the quantitative
thresholds laid down in this Regulation.


(71)

To ensure the effectiveness of the review of gatekeeper status, as well as the possibility to
adjust the list of core platform services provided by a gatekeeper, the gatekeepers should
inform the Commission of all of their intended acquisitions, prior to their
implementation, of other undertakings providing core platform services or any other
services provided within the digital sector or other services that enable the collection of
data. Such information should not only serve the review process regarding the status of
individual gatekeepers, but will also provide information that is crucial to monitoring
broader contestability trends in the digital sector and can therefore be a useful factor for
consideration in the context of the market investigations provided for by this Regulation.
Furthermore, the Commission should inform Member States of such information, given
the possibility of using the information for national merger control purposes and as,
under certain circumstances, it is possible for the competent national authority to refer
those acquisitions to the Commission for the purposes of merger control. The
Commission should also publish annually a list of acquisitions of which it has been
informed by the gatekeeper. To ensure the necessary transparency and usefulness of
such information for different purposes provided for by this Regulation, gatekeepers
should provide at least information about the undertakings concerned by the
concentration, their Union and worldwide annual turnover, their field of activity,
including activities directly related to the concentration, the transaction value or an
estimation thereof, a summary of the concentration, including its nature and rationale,
as well as a list of the Member States concerned by the operation.



(72)

The data protection and privacy interests of end users are relevant to any assessment of
potential negative effects of the observed practice of gatekeepers to collect and accumulate
large amounts of data from end users. Ensuring an adequate level of transparency of
profiling practices employed by gatekeepers, including, but not limited to, profiling,
facilitates contestability of core platform services. Transparency puts external pressure on
gatekeepers not to make deep consumer profiling the industry standard, given that
potential entrants or start-ups cannot access data to the same extent and depth, and at a
similar scale. Enhanced transparency should allow other undertakings providing core
platform services to differentiate themselves better through the use of superior privacy
guarantees. To ensure a minimum level of effectiveness of this transparency obligation,
gatekeepers should at least provide an independently audited description of the basis upon
which profiling is performed, including whether personal data and data derived from user
activity in line with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is relied on, the processing applied, the
purpose for which the profile is prepared and eventually used, the duration of the
profiling, the impact of such profiling on the gatekeeper’s services, and the steps taken to
effectively enable end users to be aware of the relevant use of such profiling, as well as
steps to seek their consent or provide them with the possibility of denying or withdrawing
consent. The Commission should transfer the audited description to the European Data
Protection Board to inform the enforcement of Union data protection rules. The
Commission should be empowered to develop the methodology and procedure for the
audited description, in consultation with the European Data Protection Supervisor, the
European Data Protection Board, civil society and experts, in line with Regulation (EU)
2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council16 and comitology rules.




(73)

In order to ensure the full and lasting achievement of the objectives of this Regulation, the
Commission should be able ▌ to assess whether an undertaking providing core platform
services should be designated as a ▌ gatekeeper without meeting the quantitative
thresholds laid down in this Regulation; whether systematic non-compliance by a
gatekeeper warrants imposing additional remedies; whether more services within the
digital sector should be added to the list of core platform services; and whether additional
practices that are similarly unfair and limiting the contestability of digital markets need to
be investigated. Such assessment should be based on market investigations to be carried
out in an appropriate timeframe, by using clear ▌ procedures and deadlines, ▌ in order to
support the ex ante effect of this Regulation on contestability and ▌ fairness in the digital
sector, and to provide the requisite degree of legal ▌ certainty ▌.


(74)

The Commission should be able to find, following a market investigation, that an
undertaking providing a core platform service fulfils all of the overarching qualitative
criteria for being identified as a gatekeeper. That undertaking should then, in principle,
comply with all of the relevant obligations laid down by this Regulation. However, for
gatekeepers that have been designated by the Commission because it is foreseeable that
they will enjoy an entrenched and durable position in the near future, the Commission
should only impose those obligations that are necessary and appropriate to prevent that the
gatekeeper concerned achieves an entrenched and durable position in its operations. With
respect to such emerging gatekeepers, the Commission should take into account that this
status is in principle of a temporary nature, and it should therefore be decided at a given
moment whether such an undertaking providing core platform services should be
subjected to the full set of gatekeeper obligations because it has acquired an entrenched
and durable position, or the conditions for designation are ultimately not met and therefore
all previously imposed obligations should be waived.


(75)

The Commission should investigate and assess whether additional behavioural, or, where
appropriate, structural remedies are justified, in order to ensure that the gatekeeper cannot
frustrate the objectives of this Regulation by systematic non-compliance with one or
several of the obligations laid down in this Regulation. This is the case where the
Commission has issued against a gatekeeper at least three non-compliance decisions
within the period of 8 years, which can concern different core platform services and
different obligations laid down in this Regulation, and if the gatekeeper has maintained,
extended or further strengthened its impact in the internal market ▌, the economic
dependency of its business users and end users on the gatekeeper’s core platform services
or the entrenchment of its position. A gatekeeper should be deemed to have maintained,
extended or strengthened its gatekeeper position where, despite the enforcement actions
taken by the Commission, that gatekeeper still holds or has further consolidated or
entrenched its importance as a gateway for business users to reach end users. The
Commission should ▌ in such cases have the power to impose any remedy, whether
behavioural or structural, having due regard to the principle of proportionality. In this
context, the Commission should have the power to prohibit, to the extent that such
remedy is proportionate and necessary in order to maintain or restore fairness and
contestability as affected by the systematic non-compliance, during a limited time-period,
the gatekeeper from entering into a concentration regarding those core platform services
or the other services provided in the digital sector or services enabling the collection of
data that are affected by the systematic non-compliance. In order to enable effective
involvement of third parties and the possibility to test remedies before its application, the
Commission should publish a detailed non-confidential summary of the case and the
measures to be taken. The Commission should be able to reopen proceedings, including
where the specified remedies turn out not to be effective. A reopening due to ineffective
remedies adopted by decision should enable the Commission to amend the remedies
prospectively. The Commission should also be able to set a reasonable time period within
which it should be possible to reopen the proceedings if the remedies prove not to be
effective.


(76)

Where, in the course of ▌ an investigation into systematic non-compliance, a gatekeeper
offers commitments to the Commission, the latter should be able to adopt a decision
making these commitments binding on the gatekeeper concerned, where it finds that the
commitments ensure effective compliance with the obligations set out in this Regulation.
That decision should also find that there are no longer grounds for action by the
Commission as regards the systematic non-compliance under investigation. In assessing
whether the commitments offered by the gatekeeper are sufficient to ensure effective
compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, the Commission should be
allowed to take into account tests undertaken by the gatekeeper to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the offered commitments in practice. The Commission should verify that
the commitments decision is fully respected and reaches its objectives, and should be
entitled to reopen the decision if it finds that the commitments are not effective.

(77)

The services in the digital sector and the types of practices relating to these services can
change quickly and to a significant extent. To ensure that this Regulation remains up to
date and constitutes an effective and holistic regulatory response to the problems posed by
gatekeepers, it is important to provide for a regular review of the lists of core platform
services, as well as of the obligations provided for in this Regulation. This is particularly
important to ensure that a practice that is likely to limit the contestability of core platform
services or is unfair is identified. While it is important to conduct a review on a regular
basis, given the dynamically changing nature of the digital sector, in order to ensure legal
certainty as to the regulatory conditions, any reviews should be conducted within a
reasonable and appropriate time-frame. Market investigations should also ensure that the
Commission has a solid evidentiary basis on which it can assess whether it should propose
to amend this Regulation in order to review, expand, or further detail, the lists of core
platform services. They should equally ensure that the Commission has a solid evidentiary
basis on which it can assess whether it should propose to amend the obligations laid down
in this Regulation or whether it should adopt a delegated act updating such obligations.


(78)

With regard to conduct by gatekeepers that is not covered by the obligations set out in
this Regulation, the Commission should have the possibility to open a market
investigation into new services and new practices for the purposes of identifying whether
the obligations set out in this Regulation are to be supplemented by means of a delegated
act falling within the scope detailed by the Regulation for such delegated acts, or by
presenting a proposal to amend this Regulation. This is without prejudice to the
possibility for the Commission to, in appropriate cases, open proceedings under Article
101 or 102 TFEU. Such proceedings should be conducted in accordance with Council
Regulation (EC) No 1/200317. In cases of urgency due to the risk of serious and
irreparable damage to competition, the Commission should consider adopting interim
measures in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003.

(79)

In the event that gatekeepers engage in a practice that is unfair or that limits the
contestability of the core platform services that are already designated under this
Regulation but without such practices being explicitly covered by the obligations laid
down by this Regulation, the Commission should be able to update this Regulation
through delegated acts. Such updates by way of delegated act should be subject to the same
investigatory standard and therefore following a market investigation. The Commission
should also apply a predefined standard in identifying such types of practices. This legal
standard should ensure that the type of obligations that gatekeepers could at any time face
under this Regulation are sufficiently predictable.

17

(80)

In order to ensure effective implementation and compliance with this Regulation, the
Commission should have strong investigative and enforcement powers, to allow it to
investigate, enforce and monitor the rules laid down in this Regulation, while at the same
time ensuring the respect for the fundamental right to be heard and to have access to the
file in the context of the enforcement proceedings. The Commission should dispose of
these investigative powers also for the purpose of carrying out market investigations,
including for the purpose of updating and reviewing this Regulation.

(81)

The Commission should be empowered to request information necessary for the purpose of
this Regulation ▌ . In particular, the Commission should have access to any relevant
documents, data, database, algorithm and information necessary to open and conduct
investigations and to monitor the compliance with the obligations laid down in this
Regulation, irrespective of who possesses such information, and regardless of their form or
format, their storage medium, or the place where they are stored.

(82)

The Commission should be able to directly request that undertakings or association of
undertakings provide any relevant evidence, data and information. In addition, the
Commission should be able to request any relevant information from competent
authorities within the Member State, or from any natural person or legal person for the
purpose of this Regulation. When complying with a decision of the Commission,
undertakings are obliged to answer factual questions and to provide documents.

(83)

The Commission should also be empowered to conduct ▌ inspections of any undertaking
or association of undertakings and to interview any persons who could be in possession of
useful information and to record the statements made.


(84)

Interim measures can be an important tool to ensure that, while an investigation is
ongoing, the infringement being investigated does not lead to serious and irreparable
damage for business users or end users of gatekeepers. This tool is important to avoid
developments that could be very difficult to reverse by a decision taken by the
Commission at the end of the proceedings. The Commission should therefore have the
power to impose interim measures by decision in the context of proceedings opened in
view of the possible adoption of a decision of non-compliance. This power should apply
in cases where the Commission has made a prima facie finding of infringement of
obligations by gatekeepers and where there is a risk of serious and irreparable damage
for business users or end users of gatekeepers. A decision imposing interim measures
should only be valid for a specified period, either one ending with the conclusion of the
proceedings by the Commission, or for a fixed period which can be renewed insofar as it
is necessary and appropriate.

(85)

The Commission should be able to take the necessary actions to monitor the effective
implementation of and compliance with the obligations laid down in this Regulation. Such
actions should include the ability of the Commission to appoint independent external
experts, and ▌ auditors to assist the Commission in this process, including where
applicable from competent authorities of the Member States, such as data or consumer
protection authorities. When appointing auditors, the Commission should ensure
sufficient rotation.


(86)

Compliance with the obligations imposed by this Regulation should be enforceable by
means of fines and periodic penalty payments. To that end, appropriate levels of fines and
periodic penalty payments should also be laid down for non-compliance with the
obligations and breach of the procedural rules subject to appropriate limitation periods, in
accordance with the principles of proportionality and ne bis in idem. The Commission
and the relevant national authorities should coordinate their enforcement efforts in
order to ensure that those principles are respected. In particular, the Commission should
take into account any fines and penalties imposed on the same legal person for the same
facts through a final decision in proceedings relating to an infringement of other Union
or national rules, so as to ensure that the overall fines and penalties imposed correspond
to the seriousness of the infringements committed.

(87)

In order to ensure effective recovery of fines imposed on associations of undertakings for
infringements that they have committed, it is necessary to lay down the conditions on
which it should be possible for the Commission to require payment of the fine from the
members of that association of undertakings where it is not solvent.

(88)

In the context of proceedings carried out under this Regulation, the undertaking concerned
should be accorded the ▌ right to be heard by the Commission and the decisions taken
should be widely publicised. While ensuring ▌ the rights to good administration ▌ , the
right of access to the file and the right to be heard, it is essential to protect confidential
information ▌ . Furthermore, while respecting the confidentiality ▌ of the information, the
Commission should ensure that any information on which the decision is based is
disclosed to an extent that allows the addressee of the decision to understand the facts and
considerations that led to the decision. It is also necessary to ensure that the Commission
only uses information collected pursuant to this Regulation for the purposes of this
Regulation, except where specifically envisaged otherwise. Finally, it should be possible,
under certain conditions, for certain business records, such as communication between
lawyers and their clients, to be ▌ considered confidential if the relevant conditions are met.

(89)

When preparing non-confidential summaries for publication in order to effectively
enable interested third parties to provide comments, the Commission should give due
regard to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of their business
secrets and other confidential information.

(90)

The coherent, effective and complementary enforcement of available legal instruments
applied to gatekeepers requires cooperation and coordination between the Commission
and national authorities within the remit of their competences. The Commission and
national authorities should cooperate and coordinate their actions necessary for the
enforcement of the available legal instruments applied to gatekeepers within the
meaning of this Regulation and respect the principle of sincere cooperation laid down in
Article 4 TFEU. It should be possible for the support from national authorities to the
Commission to include providing the Commission with all necessary information in their
possession or assistingthe Commission, at its request, with the exercise of its powers so
that the Commission is better able to carry out its duties under this Regulation.



(91)

The Commission is the sole authority empowered to enforce this Regulation. In order to
support the Commission, it should be possible for Member States to empower their
competent authorities enforcing competition rules to conduct investigations into possible
infringements of obligations under this Regulation. This could in particular be relevant
for cases where it cannot be determined from the outset whether a gatekeeper’s
behaviour is capable of infringing this Regulation, the competition rules which the
competent authority is empowered to enforce, or both. The competent authority
enforcing competition rules should report on its findings on possible infringements of
obligations under this Regulation to the Commission in view of the Commission opening
proceedings to investigate any non-compliance as the sole enforcer of the provisions laid
down by this Regulation. The Commission should have full discretion to decide whether
to open such proceedings. In order to avoid overlapping investigations under this
Regulation, the competent authority concerned should inform the Commission before
taking its first investigative measureinto a possible infringement of obligations under
this Regulation. The competent national authorities should also closely cooperate and
coordinate with the Commission when applying national competition rules against
gatekeepers, including with regard to the setting of fines. To that end, they should
inform the Commission when initiating proceedings based on national competition rules
against gatekeepers, as well as prior to imposing obligations on gatekeepers in such
proceedings. In order to avoid duplication, it should be possible for information of the
draft decision pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, where applicable, to
serve as notification under this Regulation.



(92)

In order to safeguard the harmonised application and enforcement of this Regulation, it
is important to ensure that national authorities, including national courts, have all
necessary information to ensure that their decisions do not run counter to a decision
adopted by the Commission under this Regulation. National courts should be allowed to
ask the Commission to send them information or opinions on questions concerning the
application of this Regulation. At the same time, the Commission should be able to
submit oral or written observations to national courts. This is without prejudice to the
ability of national courts to request a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU.

(93)

In order to ensure coherence and effective complementarity in the implementation of
this Regulation and of other sectoral regulations applicable to gatekeepers, the
Commission should benefit from the expertise of a dedicated high-level group. It should
be possible for that high-level group to also assist the Commission by means of advice,
expertise and recommendations, when relevant, in general matters relating to the
implementation or enforcement of this Regulation. The high-level group should be
composed of the relevant European bodies and networks, and its composition should
ensure a high level of expertise and a geographical balance. The members of the highlevel group should regularly report to the bodies and networks they represent regarding
the tasks performed in the context of the group, and consult them in that regard.

(94)

Since the decisions taken by the Commission under this Regulation are subject to review
by the Court of Justice in accordance with the TFEU, in accordance with Article 261
TFEU, the Court of Justice should have unlimited jurisdiction in respect of fines and
penalty payments.



(95)

It should be possible for the Commission to develop guidelines to provide further
guidance on different aspects of this Regulation or to assist undertakings providing core
platform services in the implementation of the obligations under this Regulation. It
should be possible for such guidance to be based in particular on the experience that the
Commission obtains through the monitoring of compliance with this Regulation. The
issuing of any guidelines under this Regulation is a prerogative and at the sole discretion
of the Commission and should not be considered to be a constitutive element in ensuring
that the undertakings or association of undertakings concerned comply with the
obligations under this Regulation.

(96)

The implementation of some of the gatekeepers’ obligations, such as those related to
data access, data portability or interoperability could be facilitated by the use of
technical standards. In this respect, it should be possible for the Commission, where
appropriate and necessary, to request European standardisation bodies to develop them.



(97)

In order to ensure contestable and fair markets in the digital sector across the Union
where gatekeepers are present, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290
TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the methodology
for determining whether the quantitative thresholds regarding active end users and
active business users for the designation of gatekeepers are met, which is contained in
an Annex to this Regulation, in respect of further specifying the additional elements of
the methodology not falling in that Annex for determining whether the quantitative
thresholds regarding the designation of gatekeepers are met, and in respect of
supplementing the existing obligations laid down in this Regulation where, based on a
market investigation, the Commission has identified the need for updating the
obligations addressing practices that limit the contestability of core platform services or
are unfair, and the update considered falls within the scope of the Regulation for such
delegated acts. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out
appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that
those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making18. In particular, to
ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament
and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States'
experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert
groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.



(98)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation,
implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to specify measures to be
implemented by gatekeepers in order to effectively comply with the obligations under this
Regulation; to suspend, in whole or in part, a specific obligation imposed on a
gatekeeper; to exempt a gatekeeper, in whole or in part, from a specific obligation; to
specify the measures to be implemented by a gatekeeper when it circumvents the
obligations under this Regulation; to conclude a market investigation for designating
gatekeepers or into systematic non-compliance; to order interim measures against a
gatekeeper; to make commitments binding on a gatekeeper; to set out its finding of a
non-compliance; to set the definitive amount of the periodic penalty payment; to
determine the form, content and other details of notifications, submissions of
information, reasoned requests and regulatory reports transmitted by gatekeepers; to lay
down operational and technical arrangements in view of implementing interoperability
and the methodology and procedure for the audited description of techniques used for
profiling consumers; to provide for practical arrangements for proceedings, extensions
of deadlines, exercising rights during proceedings, terms of disclosure, as well as for the
cooperation and coordination between the Commission and national authorities. Those
powers should be exercised in accordance ▌ with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the
European Parliament and of the Council19.



(99)

The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of an implementing act on
the practical arrangements for the cooperation and coordination between the
Commission and Member States. The advisory procedure should be used for the
remaining implementing acts envisaged by this Regulation. This is justified by the fact
that those remaining implementing acts relate to practical aspects of the procedures laid
down in this Regulation, such as form, content and other details of various procedural
steps, as well as the practical arrangements of different procedural steps, such as, for
example, extension of procedural deadlines or right to be heard.

(100)

▌In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, each Member State should be
represented in the advisory committee and decide on the composition of its delegation.
Such delegation can include, inter alia, experts from the competent authorities within
the Member States, which hold the relevant expertise for a specific issue presented to the
advisory committee.


(101)

Whistle-blowers can bring new information to the attention of competent authorities
which can help the competent authorities detect infringements of this Regulation and
enable them to impose penalties. It should be ensured that adequate arrangements are in
place to enable whistle-blowers to alert the competent authorities to actual or potential
infringements of this Regulation and to protect the whistle-blowers from retaliation. For
that purpose, it should be provided in this Regulation that Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of
the European Parliament and of the Council20 is applicable to the reporting of breaches
of this Regulation and to the protection of persons reporting such breaches.

(102)

To enhance legal certainty, the applicability, pursuant to this Regulation, of Directive
(EU) 2019/1937 to reports of breaches of this Regulation and to the protection of
persons reporting such breaches should be reflected in that Directive. The Annex to
Directive (EU) 2019/1937 should therefore be amended accordingly. It is for the
Member States to ensure that that amendment is reflected in their transposition
measures adopted in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/1937, although the adoption
of national transposition measures is not a condition for the applicability of that
Directive to the reporting of breaches of this Regulation and to the protection of
reporting persons from the date of application of this Regulation.


(103)

Consumers should be entitled to enforce their rights in relation to the obligations
imposed on gatekeepers under this Regulation through representative actions in
accordance with Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and of the
Council21. For that purpose, this Regulation should provide that Directive
(EU) 2020/1828 be applicable to the representative actions brought against
infringements by gatekeepers of provisions of this Regulation that harm or can harm the
collective interests of consumers. The Annex to that Directive should therefore be
amended accordingly. It is for the Member States to ensure that that amendment is
reflected in their transposition measures adopted in accordance with Directive
(EU) 2020/1828, although the adoption of national transposition measures in this regard
is not a condition for the applicability of that Directive to those representative actions.
The applicability of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 to the representative actions brought
against infringements by gatekeepers of provisions of this Regulation that harm or can
harm the collective interests of consumers should start from the date of application of
Member States’ laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to transpose
that Directive, or from the date of application of this Regulation, whichever is the latest.


(104)

The Commission should periodically evaluate this Regulation and closely monitor its
effects on the contestability and fairness of commercial relationships in the online platform
economy, in particular with a view to determining the need for amendments in light of
relevant technological or commercial developments. That evaluation should include the
regular review of the list of core platform services and the obligations addressed to
gatekeepers, as well as their enforcement, in view of ensuring that digital markets across
the Union are contestable and fair. In that context, the Commission should also evaluate
the scope of the obligation concerning the interoperability of number-independent
electronic communications services. In order to obtain a broad view of developments in
the digital sector, the evaluation should take into account the experiences of Member
States and relevant stakeholders. It should be possible for the Commission in this regard
also to consider the opinions and reports presented to it by the Observatory on the Online
Platform Economy that was first established by Commission Decision C(2018)2393 of 26
April 2018. Following the evaluation, the Commission should take appropriate measures.
The Commission should maintain a high level of protection and respect for the common
rights and values, particularly equality and non-discrimination, as an objective when
conducting the assessments and reviews of the practices and obligations provided in this
Regulation.


Without prejudice to the budgetary procedure and through existing financial
instruments, adequate human, financial and technical resources should be allocated to
the Commission to ensure that it can effectively perform its duties and exercise its
powers in respect of the enforcement of this Regulation.

(106)

Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure a contestable and fair digital
sector in general and core platform services in particular, with a view to promoting
innovation, high quality of digital products and services, fair and competitive prices, as
well as a high quality and choice for end users in the digital sector, cannot be sufficiently
achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the business model and
operations of the gatekeepers and the scale and effects of their operations, be better
achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle
of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with
the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go
beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.



(108)

This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised
by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Articles 16,
47 and 50 thereof. Accordingly, the interpretation and application of this Regulation
should respect those rights and principles,
