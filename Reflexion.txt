Reflexion

The pricing algorithm for DSA/DMA is written for a project that targets the shady process of lobbying. 

With a group of designers and artists, we are working on a non existed compony that has a business model of selling the Digital Service Act and the Digital Market Act, article by article. 
The company’s goal is to turn legislative data into financial assets while allowing companies and individuals to own the law and modify it to their advantage.

The work is in progress at the moment. The group members are:

Funda Zeynep Aygüler - text analysis, pricing algorithm
Katia Sophia Ditzlern - creative writing
Elena Falomo - web design
Guillaume Slizewicz - graphic design
